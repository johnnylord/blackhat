# Variables Folder

The `variables/` folder is wherer I store variables used in the project.
As you can tell from my `styles.scss` file, I use only four types of variables:
1. breakpoints
2. colors
3. typography
4. themes(optional)

I prefer to store these variables in `Sass maps`, which allow me to write functions and get values
from theme easily.
